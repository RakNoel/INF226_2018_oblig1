As for the Token, we simply made it supported from the server side, but the client implementation is mostly illustrative
and is not very user friendly. BUT it will reconnect you if connection is lost and token is still valid (10 min).

The way we store the tokens, and salt should probably be done better (eg base64 encode or something), and not only the
char values. But again, this is mostly illustrative.

We did not implement user deletion from DB as that was not in the tasks.

To use this application you will need to generate the correct JKS, and put the name and password in the Client/Server
classes-main methods

The program will generate the DB and fill tables if they do not exist.
